This is a module that implements a blueprint
this blueprint is a kind of modularization of
flask applications.
The only requirement is that you will then
import this package file in main then register the
blueprint (app_views) as shown below

app.register_blueprint(app_views)

You can also override its url_prefix like so
app.register_blueprint(app_views, url_prefix="/diff/url")
